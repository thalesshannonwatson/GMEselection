Title: Variable Selection with Generalized Maximum Entropy
Description: A variable selection procedure for regression models based on
    Generalized Maximum Entropy estimation (A. Golan, J. Judge and D. Miller,
    Maximum Entropy Econometrics, Wiley, 1996; Chapter 10). The procedure is useful
    for well- and ill-posed regression models, namely in models exhibiting small
    sample sizes, collinearity and non-normal errors.
